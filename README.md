# Plug

Plug was built using React Native via Expo, Redux, Ruby on Rails and PostgresQl. This was my Mod-5, final project for the software engineering program at the Flatiron School in NYC. Over the course of the bootcamp, we have learned Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript and React. The objective of the Mod5 project was to combine the whole of our curriculum into a solo, final project. I decided to take on React Native as well as teach myself Redux.
